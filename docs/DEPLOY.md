### Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your preview server is via Vercel's UI. Under the hood, mailing is a Next.js application and Vercel is great at hosting these. Configuring your deployment this way will also give you easy previews on PRs and automatic deployments from your main branch.

1. Create a new project on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
2. Connect it to your git repository
3. Configure the build command to run `npx mailing server build`
4. Configure the output directory to be `.mailing/.next`

Hereâ€™s a working Vercel configuration:

#### CLI

Alternatively, `npx mailing deploy` deploys your server to Vercel via their interactive CLI. After deploying, be sure to link Vercel to your repo for automatic deployments on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

### Other hosts

If you want to deploy somewhere else, you can use `npx mailing server build` to build the production app and `npx mailing server start` to boot it on localhost.
