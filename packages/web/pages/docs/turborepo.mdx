# Turborepo Setup

Turborepo is a popular monorepo management tool. Mailing works great with Turborepo but there are a few ways to set it up depending on your needs.

### Option 1: different email templates per app

This is the simpler setup and is best if you're just using Mailing to send emails from a single app or if each one of your apps has its own templates. You can still share template _components_ across apps via a shared package but each app will have it's own emails directory with templates and previews.

To set this up, go to your appâ€™s directory and install `mailing` and `mailing-core` then setup with `npx mailing init` as usual. Full setup instructions in the [Readme](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing#setup) should just work in your app's directory.

### Option 2: package with shared emails across apps

This is a more complicated setup intended for cases where you have different apps that should all be able to send the same emails.

1. Add an internal package called packages/emails. You'll want to install `mailing`, `mailing-core`, `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` in here. If you're using typescript, you'll also need to add `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`
2. Add an packages/emails/index.ts that exports your templates and emails/index.
3. Refer to this as your [packages/emails/package.json](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing-turborepo-example/blob/shared-emails/packages/emails/package.json) entrypoint. Add a dev script to this as well to boot up the preview server when you boot your other apps.
4. Import this package into apps where you want to use it. For a next app, you'll want to add it to `transpilePackages` in your [next.config.js](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing-turborepo-example/blob/shared-emails/apps/web/next.config.js). Then you can import it into API routes that run on the server ([hello world example](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing-turborepo-example/blob/shared-emails/apps/web/pages/api/hello.tsx)).
