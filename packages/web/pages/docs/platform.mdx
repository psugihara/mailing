# Platform

## Whatâ€™s Platform?

### The email platform for teams that code

Mailing is free. Mailing Platform is the advanced version with paid features. It requires a deployment, associated database, and API key. It's designed to give you everything you need to send both marketing and transactional emails.

- Easy unsubscribe links
- Mailing lists
- Still Open Source
- Self-hosted

## Setup

To enable Mailing Platform, deploy Mailing and add a database to set up an API key. Instructions for doing this can be found in the [deployment guide](/docs/deploy).

Once you're done, you can start using [Lists](/docs/lists) to allow users to manage subscription preferences.
