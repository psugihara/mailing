# Mailing Platform [beta]

## The email platform for teams that code.

Mailing is free. Mailing Platform is the advanced version with paid features. It requires a deployment, associated database, and API key. It's designed to give you everything you need to send both marketing and transactional emails.

- Analytics (coming soon)
- Easy unsubscribe
- Mailing lists
- Still Open Source
- Self-hosted (for now)

## Pricing

$10/mo. per 100k sends/mo

## Setup

### 1. Deploy your Mailing server

See the <Link href="/docs/deploy">deployment guide</Link> if you haven't done this.

### 2. Connect a database

To use Lists, you’ll need to deploy mailing and connect
it to a postgres database by setting `MAILING_DATABASE_URL`
in your deploy environment. We reccomend [neon.tech](https://neon.tech).
We’re happy to do this for you, email peter@campsh.com and
we’ll set up a Neon database for you to connect to.
Because the API is serverless, it’s important that you use
a postgres service like neon that can handle a high number of connections.

### 3. Create an account

This secures your database. Navigate to /signup on your production instance of Mailing and set up a new account. This secures your deployment and will automatically create your Default list and an API key to use /api/sendMail as well. (Note: at the moment, we only allow one user to sign up per instance). If you need to login again in the future, visit /login. 4. Configure your clients with the api key. Any app that's calling sendMail is a client.

### 4. Set env variables

Set env variables in the environments you use `sendMail` from:

<CH.Section>

- `MAILING_API_URL` - the url of your deployed mailing instance (e.g. "https://mailing.yourdomain.com")
- `MAILING_API_KEY` - an api key from `$MAILING_API_URL/settings`

Example .env file:

```bash .env
MAILING_API_URL=https://mailing.yourdomain.com
MAILING_API_KEY=yourapikey
```

</CH.Section>
