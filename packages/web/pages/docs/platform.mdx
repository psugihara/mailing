# Whatâ€™s Platform?

## The email platform for teams that code

Mailing is free. Mailing Platform is the advanced version with paid features. It requires a deployment, associated database, and API key. It's designed to give you everything you need to send both marketing and transactional emails.

- Analytics (coming soon)
- Easy unsubscribe links
- Mailing lists
- Still Open Source
- Self-hosted (for now)

## Pricing

$10/mo. per 100k sends/mo

## Setup

To enable Mailing Platform, deploy Mailing and add a database to set up an API key.

Instructions for doing this can be found in the <Link href="/docs/deploy">deployment guide</Link>.

Once you're done, you can start using <Link href="/docs/lists">Lists</Link> to allow users to manage subscription preferences.
