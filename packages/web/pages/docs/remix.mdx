# Remix integration

Remix is fully supported but currently requires an extra step during setup.

Remix has the concept of server vs client bundles. When in doubt
it tries to make the code work for both via polyfills.
However, email can only be sent from the server and there are errors when
Remix tries to polyfill it for the browser.

One way to tell it that email stuff is purely the server's business is to
name the file `[name].server.ts`. Remix docs go into more detail [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/pages/gotchas#server-code-in-client-bundles).

After running through the initialization to generate your emails directory:

1. Move `emails/index.ts` to `emails/sendMail.server.ts`.

2. Create a new `emails/index.ts` that just imports `sendMail` from `emails/sendMail.server.ts`:

```tsx
// app/emails/index.ts
export { default } from "./sendEmail.server";
```

With this setup, Remix will know not to polyfill the email sending code and
will let you use the `sendMail` function in your API routes.
