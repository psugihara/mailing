# Building Templates

Templates are exported from `.tsx` or `.jsx` files in the `emails` directory.
They are vanilla React components with a few email-specific properties.

## MJML

MJML is a markup language for building responsive emails.
We use it to build templates because it takes a lot of guesswork
out of building responsive emails that are compatible across clients.

- [MJML overview](https://documentation.mjml.io)
- [Body components](https://documentation.mjml.io/#standard-body-components)

To use MJML from react, we use the excellent `mjml-react` package.
You'll notice that it uses a slightly different syntax than the MJML documentation but
the props are all available.

## Adding a subject

If you want to add a subject to your email, you can do so by adding a static `subject` property to your component.
This property should be a string or function that takes the props of your component and returns a string.

```tsx
type WelcomeProps = {
  name: string;
};

const Welcome: Template<WelcomeProps> = ({ name }) => (
  <Mjml>
    <MjmlBody>
      <MjmlColumn>
        <MjmlText>Hi {name},</MjmlText>
        <MjmlText>Welcome to our service!</MjmlText>
      </MjmlColumn>
    </MjmlBody>
  </Mjml>
);
Welcome.subject = ({ name }) => `Welcome ${name}!`;

export default Welcome;
```

In this example, the `Welcome ${name}!` will be used as the email subject when this template is
delivered with `sendMail`. Passing a subject into a `sendMail` call will override the subject defined on the component.

```tsx
await sendMail({
  to: "someone@something.com",
  subject: "This is a custom subjec",
  component: <Welcome name="Amelita" />,
});
```

This will send an email with the subject `"This is a custom subject"`.

## Adding preview text

Often times, email clients will show a preview of the email in the inbox.
This is called the preview or preheader text.
By default, most clients will generate this from the first few lines of text
in your email.

To specify custom text, use the `MjmlPreview` component. It will generate the appropriate hidden text.

```tsx
const MyTemplate: Template<{}> = () => (
  <Mjml>
    <MjmlHead>
      <MjmlPreview>I am the pre-header!</MjmlPreview>
    </MjmlHead>
  </Mjml>
);
```
