<h2>Build, test, send emails with React</h2>

- Email templates with React components
- MJML components that work across clients (Outlook!)
- Preview server with live reload for quick development
- Dev mode opens emails in your browser instead of sending
- Test mode for ensuring emails send and have the correct content
- Plays well with js frameworks like next.js, redwood.js, remix
- Written in TypeScript, inspired by Action Mailer from Ruby on Rails

## Setup

1. Install mailing with yarn or npm:

yarn:

```
yarn add mailing mailing-core next
```

npm:

```
npm install --save mailing mailing-core next
```

Note: you may want to add mailing as a dev dependency instead if you don't plan to use the preview function outside of development. mailing-core exports buildSendMail, which returns the sendMail function

Note: mailing requires version 17 or 18 of react and react-dom, so if you're not already in a react-based app, you'll need to add the following:

yarn:

```
yarn add react react-dom
```

npm:

```
npm install --save react react-dom
```

2. Run `npx mailing` to start the preview server and scaffold your `emails` directory. This will create the following directory for all of your emails:

```
emails
├── AccountCreated.tsx
├── NewSignIn.tsx
├── Reservation.tsx
├── ResetPassword.tsx
├── components // shared components go in here
│   ├── BulletedList.tsx
│   ├── ButtonPrimary.tsx
│   ├── Footer.tsx
│   ├── Head.tsx
│   ├── Header.tsx
│   └── theme.ts
├── index.ts // this exports sendMail and is where your SMTP config goes
└── previews // use previews to develop and check templates
    ├── AccountCreated.tsx
    ├── NewSignIn.tsx
    ├── Reservation.tsx
    └── ResetPassword.tsx
```

3. <a id="configure-transport"></a>Configure your email transport and `defaultFrom`
   in `emails/index.ts`. It defaults to nodemailer's SMTP transport, but you can
   read about others [here](https://nodemailer.com/transports/).

Example SendGrid transport:

```tsx
const transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.sendgrid.net",
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: "apikey",
    pass: process.env.SEND_GRID_KEY,
  },
});
```

4. Finally, send your first email like so:

```tsx
import sendMail from "./path/to/emails";
import AccountCreated from "emails/AccountCreated";

sendMail({
  subject: "My First Email",
  to: "tester@example.com",
  cc: "tester+cc@example.com",
  bcc: ["tester+bcc@example.com", "tester+bcc2@example.com"],
  component: <AccountCreated firstName="Amelita" />,
});
```

## Developing with email previews

Mailing includes a development mode for working on your emails. Running `npx mailing` in dev will boot the preview server on localhost:3883 and show you all previews in `emails/previews`. The previews live reload when files in the emails directory change. Previews are just functions that return one of your emails loaded up with props. We recommend grouping all previews for the same email template in a file at `emails/previews/TemplateName.tsx`.

For example, here's `emails/previews/AccountCreated.tsx`:

```tsx
import AccountCreated from "../AccountCreated";

export function accountCreated() {
  return <AccountCreated name="Amelita" />;
}
```

On the left, you'll see a list of all of your emails. On the right, you'll see an individual email preview with a mobile/desktop/HTML toggle and live reload as you edit:

<img

  alt="Mailing desktop preview"

/>

When your email is nice, send it to yourself or your QA tool of choice for final testing (we like [Litmus](<[url](https://www.litmus.com)>)):

<img

  alt="Mailing mobile preview"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609038/188352419-8e1be23a-fa64-4e61-9e36-ecac8d882959.jpg"
/>

## Testing emails with jest

When `NODE_ENV === "test"`, calling `sendMail` pushes messages into a queue for later examination. The `mail-core` package exports a couple of functions for testing that emails send with the correct content.

`function getTestMailQueue(): Promise<Mail[]>`

Retrieve the test message queue.

`function clearTestMailQueue(): Promise<void>`

Clear the test message queue. You probably want to call this before tests that use the queue.

Example:

```tsx
import sendMail from "./path/to/emails";
import { getTestMailQueue, clearTestMailQueue } from "mailing/core";
import IssueNotification from "emails/IssueNotification";

describe("Example API", () => {
  it("sends an email when an issue is ready for review", () => {
    await clearTestEmailQueue();

    // SOMETHING THAT WILL SEND AN EMAIL e.g.
    // sendMail({
    //   to: "someone@something.com",
    //   subject: "test",
    //   component: <TextEmail ... />,
    // });

    const emails = await getTestMailQueue();
    expect(emails.length).toBe(1);
    expect(emails[0].subject).toMatch("Re: An issue title");
    expect(emails[0].html).toMatch("READY FOR REVIEW");
    expect(emails[0].html).toMatch("ready for QA");
  });
});
```

## &nbsp;CLI

`npx mailing init` initializes a project then starts the development server

`npx mailing preview` launches the development server

`npx mailing server build` builds the next app in .mailing

`npx mailing server start` starts the next app built in .mailing/.next

`npx mailing server` builds and starts it

`npx mailing export-previews` exports template previews as plain html files

`npx mailing` runs init then preview

`npx mm` is a cute alias for `npx mailing`

[source entrypoint](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing/blob/main/packages/cli/src/index.ts)

### mailing.config.js

Running `npx mailing init` generates a mailing.config.js file that will be used as default options for the CLI commands. The default options are:

```
  {
    "typescript": ???, // ("true" if you have a tsconfig.json in your root, otherwise "false")
    "emailsDir": "./emails",
    "outDir": "./previews_html" // (directory for export-previews html output)
  }
```

Append --help to your CLI command for a full list of supported options. Any of these options can be added to your config file.

## &nbsp;REST API

With the REST API, you can use mailing for email templating even if most of your app is not written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

`GET /api/render` takes a template name and props and returns your rendered HTML ready to be sent. [Example](https://demo.mailing.run/api/render?templateName=AccountCreated&props=%7B%22name%22%3A%22peter%22%7D)

`GET /api/previews` returns the list of previews. [Example](https://demo.mailing.run/api/previews)

`GET /api/previews/[previewClass]/[previewFunction]` returns the rendered preview and data for `/previews/[previewClass]/[previewFunction]`. [Example](https://demo.mailing.run/api/previews)

## &nbsp;Telemetry

To help understand how people are using mailing so that we can prioritize efforts, mailing collects some anonymized telemetry about usage.
