# What’s Mailing?

Mailing is a tool for building, testing, and sending emails with React. Here are some things that make Mailing great for rapid email development:

- Email templates with React components
- MJML components that work across clients (Outlook!)
- Preview server with live reload for quick development
- Dev mode opens emails in your browser instead of sending
- Test mode for ensuring emails send and have the correct content
- Plays well with js frameworks like next.js, redwood.js, remix
- Written in TypeScript, inspired by Action Mailer from Ruby on Rails

## Getting started

1. Install mailing with yarn or npm:

<CH.Code>

```bash yarn
yarn add mailing-core next react react-dom
yarn add --dev mailing
```

```bash npm
npm install --save mailing-core next react react-dom
npm install --save --dev mailing
```

</CH.Code>

2. Run `npx mailing` to start the preview server and scaffold your `emails` directory. This will create the following directory for all of your emails:

```
emails
├── AccountCreated.tsx
├── NewSignIn.tsx
├── Reservation.tsx
├── ResetPassword.tsx
├── components // shared components go in here
│   ├── BulletedList.tsx
│   ├── ButtonPrimary.tsx
│   ├── Footer.tsx
│   ├── Head.tsx
│   ├── Header.tsx
│   └── theme.ts
├── index.ts // this exports sendMail and is where your SMTP config goes
└── previews // use previews to develop and check templates
    ├── AccountCreated.tsx
    ├── NewSignIn.tsx
    ├── Reservation.tsx
    └── ResetPassword.tsx
```

3. <a id="configure-transport"></a>Configure your email transport and `defaultFrom`
   in `emails/index.ts`. It defaults to nodemailer's SMTP transport, but you can
   read about others [here](https://nodemailer.com/transports/).

Example SendGrid transport:

```tsx
const transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.sendgrid.net",
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: "apikey",
    pass: process.env.SEND_GRID_KEY,
  },
});
```

4. Finally, send your first email like so:

```tsx
import sendMail from "./path/to/emails";
import AccountCreated from "emails/AccountCreated";

await sendMail({
  subject: "My First Email",
  to: "tester@example.com",
  cc: "tester+cc@example.com",
  bcc: ["tester+bcc@example.com", "tester+bcc2@example.com"],
  component: <AccountCreated firstName="Amelita" />,
});
```

This will send an email with the subject "My First Email" to the `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` addresses. The `component` prop is the React component that will be rendered to HTML for the email.

## Developing with email previews

Running `npx mailing` will boot the preview server on localhost:3883
and show you all previews in `emails/previews`. The previews live reload
when files in the emails directory change. Previews are just functions
that return one of your emails loaded up with props. You can use them to
render your templates in different contexts and related templates can be
grouped in the same preview file. You can make your preview function
async if you'd like to fetch data inside of it.

For example, here's `emails/previews/AccountCreated.tsx`:

```tsx
import AccountCreated from "../AccountCreated";

export function accountCreated() {
  return <AccountCreated name="Amelita" />;
}
```

On the left, you'll see a list of all of your emails. On the right, you'll see an individual email preview with a mobile/desktop/HTML toggle and live reload as you edit:

<img

  alt="Mailing desktop preview"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609038/188324943-729009f0-c6f2-45a5-87b7-ae6338d7c45f.jpg"
/>

When your email is nice, send it to yourself or your QA tool of choice for final testing (we like <Link href="https://www.litmus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Litmus</Link>):

<img
  width="600"
  alt="Mailing mobile preview"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609038/188352419-8e1be23a-fa64-4e61-9e36-ecac8d882959.jpg"
/>

## sendMail

The main API for using mailing from your app is `sendMail`. This function is built on nodemailer's `sendMail` function, so you can pass in any options that nodemailer supports. The main difference is that you pass in a React component instead of an HTML string, the component is rendered to HTML and sent as the email body.

To configure your `sendMail` function, edit the `emails/index.ts` file where it's built and exported. This is where you'll configure your email transport and set your `defaultFrom` address. You can also add any other options that nodemailer supports.

You can also access `sendMail` via the <Link href="/docs/rest-api">REST API</Link>.

## Testing emails with jest

When `NODE_ENV === "test"`, calling `sendMail` pushes messages into a queue for later examination. The `mail-core` package exports a couple of functions for testing that emails send with the correct content.

`function getTestMailQueue(): Promise<Mail[]>`

Retrieve the test message queue.

`function clearTestMailQueue(): Promise<void>`

Clear the test message queue. You probably want to call this before tests that use the queue.

Example:

```tsx
import sendMail from "./path/to/emails";
import { getTestMailQueue, clearTestMailQueue } from "mailing/core";
import IssueNotification from "emails/IssueNotification";

describe("Example API", () => {
  it("sends an email when an issue is ready for review", () => {
    await clearTestEmailQueue();

    // SOMETHING THAT WILL SEND AN EMAIL e.g.
    // sendMail({
    //   to: "someone@something.com",
    //   subject: "test",
    //   component: <TextEmail ... />,
    // });

    const emails = await getTestMailQueue();
    expect(emails.length).toBe(1);
    expect(emails[0].subject).toMatch("Re: An issue title");
    expect(emails[0].html).toMatch("READY FOR REVIEW");
    expect(emails[0].html).toMatch("ready for QA");
  });
});
```

## CLI

`npx mailing init` initializes a project then starts the development server

`npx mailing preview` launches the development server

`npx mailing server build` builds the next app in .mailing

`npx mailing server start` starts the next app built in .mailing/.next

`npx mailing server` builds and starts it

`npx mailing export-previews` exports template previews as plain html files

`npx mailing` runs init then preview

Append `--help` to your CLI command for a full list of supported options. Any of these options can be added to your config file.

### mailing.config.json

Running `npx mailing init` generates a mailing.config.json file that will be used as default options for the CLI commands. The default options are:

```
  {
    "typescript": ???, // ("true" if you have a tsconfig.json in your root, otherwise "false")
    "emailsDir": "./emails",
    "outDir": "./previews_html" // (directory for export-previews html output)
  }
```

### Telemetry

To understand how people are using mailing so that we can prioritize our effort, Mailing collects some anonymized usage telemetry. To opt out, remove the `anonymousId` from your mailing.config.json file.
