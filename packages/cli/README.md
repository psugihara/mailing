<h2>●&nbsp;&nbsp;Build, test, send emails with React</h2>

- Build email templates with React components
- MJML components that work across clients (Outlook!)
- Preview server with live reload for quick development
- Dev mode opens emails in your browser instead of sending
- Test mode for ensuring emails send and have the correct content
- Plays well with js frameworks like next.js, redwood.js, remix
- Written in TypeScript, inspired by Action Mailer from Ruby on Rails

<br/>

## ●&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?

We’re longtime users of Action Mailer and wanted something similar for our typescript/react apps. We didn’t find anything, so we decided to build Mailing. We added some features that we would’ve liked in Action Mailer, like a mobile toggle (with hotkeys), and the ability to send a test email from the browser while developing. We went all in on MJML so that we (almost) never have to think about email clients or nested tables :)
